Some Windows systems do not come with curl. You need to run it before using it for the first time. Double-click the self-extracting curl.exe to automatically decompress curl.exe and run the file to the current directory.
If the system already contains curl, please do not decompress this curl (cmd input curl to see if the returned result is curl: try 'curl --help' for more information)
Windows 7 users use the ANSI encoded version
Windows 8 and above users use the UTF-8 encoded version
Note: The ANSI encoding version can also be used on all Windows platforms, and the BUG of some Windows systems will cause the console to output garbled characters

Forked version note: as this file is translated in English it isn't really important if you use ANSI or UTF-8 version so I decided to merge both together and make it avaible on all windows versions, enjoy this code
